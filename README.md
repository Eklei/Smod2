## ServerMod Installation:
To install via [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) (includes the base game and ServerMod):
1. Download SteamCMD, and extract it to a new folder. Be aware that it will fill the folder with its own files.
2. Create a text file to be used as the install script (uncomment one of the "app_update" lines):
```
@ShutdownOnFailedCommand 1
@NoPromptForPassword 1
login anonymous
force_install_dir "your/desired/install location/here"
//app_update 786920 validate //uncomment this line if you want the stable branch
//app_update 786920 -beta beta validate //uncomment this line if you want the beta branch
quit
```
3. Create a batch file or shortcut to run SteamCMD: `steamcmd +runscript "path/to/install script.txt"`
4. Run the batch file or shortcut. If SteamCMD reports that " @ShutdownOnFailedCommand" is an unknown command, make sure that the text file is not saved with UTF-8 Signature / Unicode BOM (Byte-Order Mark). A batch file likewise won't work if saved that way.

To install via Steam Library:
1. Open your Library in Steam.
2. In the upper left is a search box. In that box, click the word "GAMES" and change it to "TOOLS".
3. Search for SCP. You should see "SCP: Secret Laboratory ServerMod".
4. If you want the stable branch, just install what you see. If you want the beta branch, right click it, "Properties", "Betas", select the beta in the dropdown, then install it.

To install via Steam URI (on Windows with Steam installed):
1. Launch `steam://install/786920-beta` (using "Run", File Explorer address bar, or web browser address bar)
2. This installs the stable branch by default. If you want the beta branch, you'll need to follow the directions using the Steam Library, which can still be done after installing it this way.

To install manually:
1. Download Assembly-CSharp.dll and Smod2.dll from the [latest release](https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/releases/latest) or from some other release in the [releases tab](https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/releases).
2. Navigate to your SCP Secret Lab folder. For example, `"C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\SCP Secret Laboratory\"`
3. Create a **copy** of this directory somewhere else. ServerMod needs its own directory. Installing it in the same directory from which you play the game will prevent the game from working properly.
4. Inside the resulting new directory, navigate to `"SCPSL_Data\Managed\"`
5. Remove Assembly-CSharp.dll (you can delete it, or rename it as a backup if you want).
6. Copy the downloaded Assembly-CSharp.dll and Smod2.dll into that folder.

## Server Name Variables
Currently supported variables (place in your servers name):
- $player_count (current number of connected players) EG: "$player_count playing!"
- $port (the port of the current server) EG: "Welcome to SCPServer.com:$port"
- $ip (the ip of the server) EG: "Welcome to SCPServer.com [$ip:$port]"
- $full_player_count (will display player count as $player_count/$max_player_count or FULL if there are $max_player_count players) EG: "Server.com $full_player_count"
- $number (will display the number of the instance, assuming youre using default ports, this works by subtracting 7776 from the port (so $number will = 1 for the first server, #2 for the second)
- $lobby_id (debugging to print the lobby_id)
- $version (version of the game)
- $sm_version (version of ServerMod)
- $max_players (max amount of players in the config)
- $scp_alive - number of alive SCPS.
- $scp_start - number of SCPs at start of the round.
- $scp_counter - prints $scp_alive/$scp_start
- $scp_dead - number of dead scps.
- $scp_zombies - current number of zombies.
- $classd_escape - how many class ds have escaped.
- $classd_start - the amount of starting class ds.
- $classd_counter - $classd_escape/$classd_counter.
- $scientists_escape - The number of scientists to escape so far.
- $scientists_start - the amount of starting scientists
- $scientists_counter - $scientists_escape/$scientist_start.
- $scp_kills - number of people killed by scps.
- $warhead_detonated - prints ☢ WARHEAD DETONATED ☢ if its gone off.

## Config Additions
Type Info:
- Boolean: True or False value
- Integer: A number without decimals
- Float: A number with decimals (Formatting like "1.0" and "1,0" both work and are the same value)
- List: A list with items separated by ",", for example: `list: 1,2,3,4,5`
- Dictionary: A dictionary with items separated by ":", and each entry separated by ",", for example: `dictionary: 1:2,2:3,3:4`
- Seconds: Time in seconds, usually a value of -1 disables the feature
- Minutes: Time in minutes, usually a value of -1 disables the feature
- R: If the config option has an R before it, it means that you can use a random value in it. A random value is defined by having "{}", items listed like "weight%value" where if you don't put a weight it defaults to a weight of 1, separated by "|", for example: `rlist: {1%1|2%7|6},3,6,{15%3|2|45%2}` `RDictionary: {6%1:1|2%1:6|2%1:8|1:10|2%1:13}`

Everything following and including the "//" is optional

Update as of ServerMod 3.1.6:
As of now, formatting will be less enforced, there can now be empty lines, commented out lines, and multiple comment symbols

For comment symbols, the current default is "//" or "#", you can add your own using the `reserved_slots_comment_symbol` config option

Example Usage:
```
1.1.1.1 // IP
11111111111111111 // SteamID64 (Automatically fetches IP)
